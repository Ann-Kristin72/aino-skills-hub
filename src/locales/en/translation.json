    "section1_title": "1. Introduction – A world problem we have chosen to solve",
    "section1_content": "Ever since the World Health Organization presented the report Working Together for Health in 2006, the world has known that we face a staffing crisis in healthcare services. At that time, WHO estimated that 57 countries had critical shortages of doctors, nurses and midwives – and the global gap was calculated at 2.4 million healthcare workers. At the same time, it was pointed out that this shortage was not a coincidence. It was the result of weak education systems, insufficient planning and a persistent imbalance between rich and poor countries.<br/><br/>In the years since, this problem has not been solved – it has intensified. Particularly in high-income countries like Norway, Sweden, the UK and other OECD countries, we have solved our own staffing crisis by recruiting qualified labor from countries that themselves have scarce resources. This has created a global injustice that WHO has warned against in a series of updated strategies, most recently in Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030.<br/><br/>At the same time, we in the West have closed our eyes to the fact that the problem actually lies much closer: We have not managed to educate, use and retain enough healthcare personnel in our own systems. Instead, we have compensated by buying temporary staff at record prices and letting unskilled labor fill the gaps in shift schedules, without them receiving the necessary training. In Norway alone, reports from the Norwegian Directorate of Health show that over 72,530 full-time equivalents are performed by employees without healthcare education – and the use of temporary staff has now passed four billion kroner per year. These are numbers that make investors open their eyes – because they show that we pay for the consequences, but refuse to address the causes.",
    "section2_title": "2. Norway and the Nordics – demographics as an excuse",
    "section2_content": "In Norway and the rest of the Nordics, the term \"demographics\" has become a constant refrain when politicians explain why healthcare services are under pressure. We are told that we are getting older, that we are getting fewer young people, and that we therefore must \"adapt\". This is of course correct as fact: The proportion of elderly is increasing. But internationally, it is striking that the term \"demographics\" is hardly used in the same way. When WHO or OECD talk about healthcare staffing, they talk about capacity in education, work environment, recruitment and task distribution – not primarily about demographics.<br/><br/>In practice, \"demographics\" is used as an excuse to cover up a system failure: We have not planned for the education of enough people. We have allowed professionals to quit because the work environment is too demanding. We have not managed to recruit broadly enough in the districts. And when the gaps become large, we pay for temporary staff and emergency solutions instead of building up long-term structures.",
    "section3_title": "3. What do low-income countries like Uganda do – and what can we learn?",
    "section3_content": "In contrast to this ad-hoc model, we find one of the most successful examples of national ownership of local healthcare staffing: Uganda. Already in the 1990s, Uganda began building up its Community Health Workers – village healthcare workers who are recruited locally, receive simple but targeted training and solve very basic healthcare tasks. Today, Uganda has over 179,000 Community Health Workers who cover 75 percent of the country.<br/><br/>The results speak for themselves: Maternal mortality has fallen from 506 per 100,000 births to 336. Child vaccination coverage has increased from 52 percent to over 80 percent. Malaria deaths have more than halved in villages that have Community Health Workers. The model is simple, cheap and sustainable, and WHO and UNICEF have highlighted it as \"best practice\" for resource-poor countries.<br/><br/>The point is this: Uganda has done manually what we in JodaSkills and I-know can now do digitally – and on a global scale.",
    "section4_title": "4. Norway – consequences of not learning from the best",
    "section4_content": "In Norway, we lack a comprehensive strategy for how we should systematically use unskilled labor as a resource – not as a patch on a hole. Today we have a situation where unskilled employees can go from working in kindergarten one week to handling dementia patients without relevant training the next week. A nurse with a bachelor's degree gets three weeks for overlap when she starts a new job at a nursing home. An unskilled assistant gets three shifts and a checklist. The rest they must learn \"on the job\".<br/><br/>The price is paid in turnover, failure in patient safety and high costs for temporary staff. KS has estimated that turnover for unskilled workers alone costs the municipal sector over 297 million kroner annually. When you add temporary agency costs, we're talking about over four billion kroner in pure firefighting.",
    "section5_title": "5. The global calculation",
    "section5_content": "According to McKinsey's report Closing the gap on the healthcare workforce shortage from May 2023, closing the gap in the healthcare workforce can reduce the global disease burden by a full seven percent and add 1.1 trillion dollars in annual value creation to the world economy. This is not small change. This is the number of what we lose because we don't solve the staffing crisis in a smart way.",
    "section6_title": "6. Who are these healthcare workers really – and why are they our key",
    "section6_content": "When we in JodaSkills talk about \"the unskilled\", we are not talking about a uniform mass. We are talking about people of all ages – from 17 to 70 years old – with very different prerequisites for learning, understanding and being understood. They represent different cultures, different languages, different digital skills – but they have one thing in common: They are on the front line of keeping elderly care and large parts of the care service going when everything else falters.<br/><br/>In Norway, this group comprises over 72,000 employees today (Source: Norwegian Directorate of Health, \"Personnel composition and training needs in the care and welfare sector\", 2024). They do everything from care and personal hygiene to cooking, activation, transport and practical tasks. They are often the first to see a deterioration in a patient's condition – but they rarely have the competence to assess what should be done next, or to communicate it in the right way.<br/><br/>Internationally, this picture is similar. The world's healthcare workers at grassroots level – from Uganda's Community Health Workers to care assistants in Europe – share the same need: They must understand what they should do. They must know where to turn when something goes wrong. And they must have access to updated knowledge in a language and format they actually understand.<br/><br/>This is why WHO in its Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health (2016) and WHO Community Health Worker Guidelines (2018) highlights the need to \"think anew about who we train, what we train them in, and how we do it\" (Source: WHO HRH Strategy 2030, WHO CHW Guidelines 2018).",
    "section7_title": "7. Learning – from classroom to artificial intelligence",
    "section7_content": "In the healthcare sector, we have long held on to an old-fashioned way of thinking about training: New employees should sit in classrooms, attend mandatory courses, read heavy procedures and remember everything – then practice it perfectly when they meet a real patient. This was sensible when we had stable staffing, high professional coverage and time to give everyone guidance.<br/><br/>This is no longer the case. The world has changed how we learn. Today, people use their mobile phones to look up what they need – when they need it. We watch short videos, we search in chat, we ask a question to an AI or colleague and get an answer immediately. This is the reality for learning in 2025 – but in healthcare we still force employees to spend hours on generic e-learning courses that they must complete to \"have documented training\".<br/><br/>The result is well known: The courses are completed, but the knowledge is forgotten as quickly as it was memorized. Leaders have no real overview of what employees actually can do – other than that they have \"completed\" a course. This is well documented in several Fafo studies and in figures from KS, which show that the knowledge level in the front line varies dramatically (Source: Fafo 2023, KS Competence Status 2024).",
    "section8_title": "8. The five major wounds – the problem summarized",
    "section8_content": "After over ten years of research and development work in Dynamisk Helse and Jodacare, and through countless interviews with healthcare personnel, leaders and relatives, we have identified five major wounds that drain the sector of money, power and safety:<br/><ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2\"><li><strong>Technology in the museum:</strong> Municipalities invest billions in welfare technology that never gets used because no one teaches people how to use it in a practical way. Source: Norwegian Directorate of Health Welfare Technology Report 2022.</li><li><strong>Communication gone wrong:</strong> In the absence of secure communication channels, employees establish their own groups on Messenger, Snap and Facebook. Here, confidential information flows together with informal chat – without traceability or security.

    "section9_title": "9. The consequences – what does it cost us?",
    "section9_content": "For Norway alone, the calculation shows that we annually spend over four billion kroner on temporary staff, 297 million kroner on training unskilled workers who often quit within 12 months, and millions in lost gains due to errors and deviations that could have been avoided (Sources: KS, Fafo, Norwegian Directorate of Health).<br/><br/>Globally, the picture is even larger. According to McKinsey, a smarter utilization of the workforce and better training can remove seven percent of the disease burden and add 1.1 trillion dollars in increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs to the world economy (Source: McKinsey, \"Closing the gap on the healthcare workforce shortage\", 2023).",
    "section10_title": "10. A new path: JodaSkills and I-know",
    "section10_content": "We have spent years understanding what actually works, and even more years building technology that can carry it. Our experience from two companies, SkillAid (Dynamisk Helse) and Jodacare, has taught us that the solution is never one new course, one new app or one new portal. The solution lies in a coherent ecosystem that connects knowledge, quality, technology, communication and tasks – in real time, in a language people understand.<br/><br/>This is the essence of I-know – our new platform that for the first time digitizes the principles behind Uganda's Community Health Worker model for a global, modern healthcare system.",
